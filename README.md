# Personal Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. As someone who has recently transitioned from a background in photography to front-end development, this project holds particular significance for me.

## Background

Previously, I maintained a separate website dedicated to showcasing my photography portfolio. However, with my newfound skills in front-end development, I saw an opportunity to elevate my online presence. I set out to rebuild my portfolio website from scratch using Next.js, a React framework for building efficient and scalable web applications.

## Project Details

- **Technology Stack:** Next.js, React, Tailwind
- **Hosting Platform:** Hostinger

## Accomplishments

The completion of this project marks a significant milestone in my journey as a front-end developer. By leveraging my new skills, I successfully replicated my previous photography portfolio website using Next.js. Hosting it myself on Hostinger adds a layer of control and customization that I didn't have before.

## Future Goals

With this project, I've achieved a goal that I set for myself at the beginning of my front-end development journey. Looking ahead, I aim to continue refining and expanding my skills, exploring new technologies, and further enhancing my portfolio website to reflect my growth and capabilities.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website!
