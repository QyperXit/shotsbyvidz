    info: `Hello and welcome! I'm Shaun, a professional photographer and CAA-certified drone pilot based in Birmingham. What began as a passion for capturing images has evolved into a dedicated career providing high-impact visual solutions.

I specialize in Real Estate and Commercial media, holding an A2 Certificate of Competency (A2 CofC) for safe and legal operations. My expertise spans two distinct aerial styles: precision drone photography for architectural surveys and property marketing, and dynamic FPV (First Person View) piloting.

The addition of FPV allows me to offer something truly unique—immersive, cinematic fly-throughs that dive into the action. This style is perfect for capturing the energy of live events, festivals, and automotive shoots, or creating seamless "one-shot" tours through large indoor properties.

While I focus on the commercial side, my artistic background in street and still life photography ensures every frame is composed with creativity and care. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible, constantly refining my flight skills and editing techniques.

Whether you need technical roof inspections, stunning real estate listings, or high-energy FPV content for your next event, I’m ready to deliver. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch to discuss your project.`,
