    info: `Hello and welcome! I'm Shaun, a professional photographer and CAA-certified drone pilot based in Birmingham. What began as a passion for capturing images has evolved into a dedicated career providing high-impact visual solutions.

I specialize in Wedding Videography and Live Events, holding an A2 Certificate of Competency (A2 CofC) for safe and legal operations. My expertise spans two distinct aerial styles: cinematic drone shots for wedding films and dynamic FPV (First Person View) piloting that immerses viewers in the moment.

The addition of FPV allows me to offer something truly unique—immersive, cinematic fly-throughs that dive into the action. This style is perfect for capturing the energy of weddings, festivals, and automotive events, or creating seamless "one-shot" tours through venues.

While I focus on capturing special moments, my artistic background in street and still life photography ensures every frame is composed with creativity and care. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible, constantly refining my flight skills and editing techniques.

Whether you need a breathtaking wedding film, high-energy event coverage, or unique FPV content, I’m ready to deliver. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch to discuss your project.`,
